# US Health Insurance Premiums Analysis

This repository contains the code and analysis for modeling individuals' health insurance charges in the United States based on demographic information such as BMI, region, smoking status, number of children, sex, and age.

**Objective**
The primary goal of this project was to develop predictive models to forecast health insurance premiums accurately. 

**Approach**
- **Data Collection**: Gathered data from insurance companies to inform predictive modeling efforts.
- **Modeling Techniques**: Utilized various machine learning algorithms including Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Boosted Trees.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated models using cross-validation techniques to estimate mean squared error (MSE) and compared performance metrics.
- **Feature Engineering**: Implemented feature engineering techniques to enhance the predictive power of the models, resulting in a 10% increase in prediction accuracy. Leveraged domain knowledge to extract meaningful insights from raw data.

**Results**
- The Boosted model outperformed other models based on test MSE results.
- Detailed analysis and insights are provided in the R Markdown file included in this repository.
